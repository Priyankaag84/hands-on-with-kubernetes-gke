# Hands on with Kubernetes Workshop Series - GKE

The following repository will help you create a Kubernetes cluster running on Google Container Engine:

1. Sign up for a Google Cloud account:
    1. FREE TRIAL: $300 of Google Cloud for 12 months https://cloud.google.com/free/
    2. FREE KUBERNETES TIER: up to 5 nodes of Google Container Engine (GKE) are free. Note the underlining Google Compute Engine counts towards the $300 from the FREE TRIAL. 
    3. Keep the Google Cloud console open once you signed up: https://console.cloud.google.com/ 
2. Click link to navigate in the Google Cloud Console to API Manager > Library https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library. Enable the Compute Engine and Container Engine API:

3. Download Google SDK for Mac, Linux or Windows: https://cloud.google.com/sdk/ The SDK is used to run commands in PowerShell (Windows) or the Mac OS X terminal. 
4. Clone of this repo to upload applications

You will find the presentation, links, commands and group questions pinned in the _#k8satgoogle_ channel

## Create Infrastructure & Provision Cluster

A list of steps to build and provision the Kubernetes cluster can be found [here](docs/3-build-cluster.md)

## Using Kubernetes

The presenter will go through a list of demos during the workshop.

Find the demos [here](docs/demos)

## Destroying Cluster After Training

Congrats on finishing the hands on introduction to Kubernetes!

To remove the Kubernetes cluster and underlying infrastructure execute the following from your local machine.

```
$ gcloud container clusters delete [NAME OF CLUSTER] --zone "[ZONE]"
```
If you used the standard command in this workshop to start the cluster than copy and paste the following:

```
$ gcloud container clusters delete k8strainingcluster --zone "us-west1-a"
```
You will still have roughly $300 in Google Cloud credits you can use to test out Kubernetes more.
